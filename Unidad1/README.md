FIRST VIDEO:
What is a distributed system?
A system that is divided into several computers in such a way that it is not a centralized system, since its processes run on different computers.
example: save a file to your computer, if it fails your file will be lost unless the hard drive is not damaged and can be recovered in some way.
In a distributed system your document would be stored in the cloud, so that if your computer will stop serving, you will still have access to your files from any other computer.
